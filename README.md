# nba_scraping_and_writing
Learning how to scrape and write table info to CSV.  Used NBA data... fun!

I'm in the learning phase... I followed about 10 YouTube videos to get this far, and read through a few comments.  This is my first Python script that I've written, so please go easy on me if any of this looks ridiculous!

I want to give a shoutout to some of those who helped me get this far: 
SAF Business Analytics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8wUYz22joM
M Jiang's comment in the above video for the writing to CSV info
Programming for Finance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwsnpRNl9-I&t=374s
Jake VanderPlas for his book Python Data Science Handbook for giving me a head start!
NBA Stuffer for their website that we're scraping: https://www.nbastuffer.com/2017-2018-nba-player-stats/

Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions in how to improve this code, or some fun ideas on what to do with the final product!  Maybe a cool data dump in Excel that leads to draft suggestions... idk!  

Peace
